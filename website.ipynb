    "## Abstract\n",
    "The study of Galactic Dynamos, particularly through mean-field models, provides crucial insights into the generation and evolution of magnetic fields in galaxies. We can use mean-field induction equation to understand the fundamental processes underlying these magnetic fields, which play a pivotal role in shaping galactic structure and evolution.We employed numerical simulations and analytical techniques to solve the mean-field induction equation, considering both the One-dimensional formulation and the simplified no-z approximation. We used crank-nicolson method to solve for the different components of the magnetic field. We solved for different values of the dynamo number to get decaying or growing cases and calculated the critical dynamo number.We also tested whether the no-z approximation, which neglects the vertical component of the magnetic field, adequately captures the dynamo processes in galaxies.We find that the critical dynamo number from the no-z approximation is similiar to the critical dynamo number we calculated from the numerical simulation.\n"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Galactic magnetic fields influence the structure, dynamics, and evolution of galaxies. Galactic magnetic fields exhibit a remarkable diversity of structures, spanning from small-scale turbulent fluctuations to large-scale coherent structures extending across entire galaxies. Observations across different wavelengths, from radio to optical and X-ray, have provided invaluable insights into the morphology and strength of galactic magnetic fields. One of the most striking features is the presence of large-scale magnetic fields, which often display a spiral or axisymmetric morphology that is closely intertwined with the spiral arms and overall gas distribution of galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Galactic Dynamo theory builds upon the principles of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) to describe the amplification and evolution of magnetic fields in galaxies. At its core, Galactic Dynamo theory tells that small-scale seed magnetic fields can be amplified and stretched by differential rotation and turbulent motions within the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. The amplification process is facilitated by the induction equation, which describes how the magnetic field evolves in response to the velocity field of the ISM and the existing magnetic field configuration.Central to Galactic Dynamo theory is the concept of alpha–omega dynamos, wherein the generation of magnetic fields is driven by the combined action of differential rotation (the omega effect) and helical turbulence (the alpha effect). This dynamo mechanism is thought to be responsible for the generation of large-scale magnetic fields in galaxies, with the observed morphological and statistical properties of galactic magnetic fields providing crucial constraints on dynamo models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we delve into the intricacies of Galactic Dynamo theory, aiming to explore its predictions and implications for the generation and evolution of large-scale magnetic fields in galaxies. By examining the underlying physical processes and numerical simulations, we seek to deepen our understanding of galactic magnetic fields and the dynamo mechanisms that govern their behavior."
